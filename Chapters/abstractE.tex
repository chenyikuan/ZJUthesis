With the continuous development in the field of industrial robots, programming by demonstration has become a very advanced research topic. The technology of programming by demonstration provides a new way to convey information to industrial robots and is an important way to simplify robot programming. Comparing with the traditional robot programming method, it can greatly minimize the professional knowledge required by industrial application technicians in robotic using and programming, which is of great significance for the popularizing of robots. Object pose estimation is a very important part in programming by demonstration. However, there is no economical object pose estimation algorithm yet, which makes many flexible manufacturing industries low in productivity
. Therefore, this paper presents a new simple six-dimensional pose estimation algorithm framework. In the process of research and development of the algorithm framework, this paper mainly contains following parts:


\begin{itemize}
\item By studying the integrated learning method, we focus on the branch of random fern algorithm. The random fern algorithm is used to solve the classification problem in the early stage of the study, and has more excellent precision and efficiency than the random forest algorithm. But the disadvantage is that it can not be applied to the regression problem. In this paper, by summarizing the experience of predecessors, we proposed a modified fern algorithm whitch can be applied to regression problem. In addition, a advanced random fern algorithm is proposed based on the fact that many features input have large interference and cause disaster to regression tasks. The advanced random fern algorithm can be adaptively modified by using the easily accessible feature confidence mask, so that the modified random fern algorithm can still maintain good regression accuracy and robustness.

\item In order to make the object pose estimation algorithm get higher application value, or to be able to train a pose estimation model of a new part in a short time, this paper use the OpenGL software platform to build a depth camera simulation environment, in order to efficiently produce a large number of labeled depth image data. The simulation environment can pre-load the background information of industrial scene and also can simulate the objects occlusion. Because of the resulting simulation depth image is more real and rich, the training results of pose estimation model is closer to the model trained by real data. In the end, this paper also proposes how to repair the holes in the depth image collected by the real depth camera in order to further reduce the difference between the simulated depth image and the true depth image.

\item A novel algorithm of six-dimensional pose estimation algorithm is proposed in this paper. First of all, a new method of depth image feature description based on pixel difference features in depth image is discussed. The feature description method is very computational efficient and alse has scale invariance feature. It can well capture the object location and orientation information of the specified position in the depth image. Then the supervised hashing method is briefly introduced. The hashing method can significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the original feature and make the training of object pose estimation model more robust. Then, with the help of the random fern regression algorithm proposed in this paper, a  cascade regression algorithm framework for object pose estimation is proposed, which fixes the problem that the regression target in the general cascade regression algorithm framework is too restricted. Finally, an improved random fern regression algorithm is also proposed to handle object pose estimation under occlusion. And the object detection is performed by using the feature descriptors used in pose regression. Totally, all this methods forms a complete object pose estimation algorithm framework.
